# CareDroid Neural Network Readiness & Concern Report

## Objective
Design a practical path for CareDroid to own more of its neural stack while preserving current safety features (emergency recall, escalation workflows, audit logging, and RAG grounding).

## 1) Current System Scan (What Already Exists)

### 1.1 Existing AI Routing in Production Backend
- CareDroid already uses a **three-phase intent pipeline** in `IntentClassifierService`:
  1. keyword matcher,
  2. external NLU model call (`/predict`),
  3. LLM fallback (via GPT JSON classification).
- This means the system is already architected for a local/owned model at the NLU layer.

### 1.2 Existing Neural Network Service (Own Model Foundation)
- There is an in-repo Python microservice at `backend/ml-services/nlu` running FastAPI.
- It exposes `/predict`, `/batch-predict`, `/health`, `/model-info`.
- It wraps a transformer classifier (`AutoModelForSequenceClassification`) with a biomedical base model default (`PubMedBERT`) and seven intent classes.
- The training scripts (`train.py`, `evaluate.py`) and labeled data files (`data/train.jsonl`, `data/val.jsonl`, `data/test.jsonl`) already exist.

### 1.3 External LLM Dependence Still Dominant for Generation
- The core conversational generation and fallback classification currently rely on OpenAI API calls in `AIService`.
- Therefore, CareDroid currently owns **intent-level NLU scaffolding** but does **not yet own the response-generation model**.

## 2) Key Concerns Identified

### Concern A — NLU exists, but production maturity is incomplete
- The TypeScript intent service itself marks the model phase as not fully implemented in comments, despite external service support.
- Intent label mapping is lossy (multiple NLU labels collapse into broader app intents), which can hide model drift in operations.
- NLU confidence threshold strategy is fixed and not role- or risk-aware.

### Concern B — “Own neural network” scope is undefined
- If “own network” means full replacement of GPT/Claude for final medical response text, current codebase is not ready for that leap in one step.
- Safer interpretation: own critical decision layers first (intent triage, emergency risk, tool routing), then progressively own generation.

### Concern C — Clinical safety + compliance implications
- Any fine-tuned generator for clinical text requires strict governance:
  - dataset provenance,
  - PHI de-identification,
  - regression/safety benchmarks,
  - hard fail-safe fallback.
- Existing emergency guarantees are keyword-first; replacing these with a pure neural detector would reduce explainability unless dual-guardrails stay in place.

### Concern D — MLOps gaps for long-term ownership
- No clear in-repo model registry/version policy, champion/challenger rollout, or automatic drift alarms tied to model versions.
- Retraining triggers and label-quality audit loops are not formalized.

## 3) Recommended Neural Architecture for “CareDroid-Owned” Path

## Phase 1 (Immediate, low risk): Strengthen Owned NLU [✅ IMPLEMENTED]

### Phase 1 Implementation Complete
**Date Completed**: February 5, 2026  
**Status**: All core features implemented and integrated into IntentClassifierService

#### Phase 1 Achievements:
1. ✅ **Expanded Intent Taxonomy** (7 primary + 4 legacy fallback intents):
   - `EMERGENCY` - Life-threatening situations
   - `EMERGENCY_RISK` - Potential emergency requiring triage
   - `MEDICATION_SAFETY` - Drug interactions, contraindications, drug checking
   - `TOOL_SELECTION` - Clinical tool invocation (SOFA, APACHE-II, etc.)
   - `PROTOCOL_LOOKUP` - Clinical protocol and guideline queries
   - `DOCUMENTATION` - Medical record and documentation queries
   - `GENERAL_CHAT` - General conversation and educational queries
   - Legacy fallbacks: `CLINICAL_TOOL`, `ADMINISTRATIVE`, `MEDICAL_REFERENCE`, `GENERAL_QUERY`

2. ✅ **Criticality-Aware Confidence Thresholds** (IntentCriticality enum):
   - **CRITICAL** (0.85+ threshold): EMERGENCY, EMERGENCY_RISK, MEDICATION_SAFETY
   - **HIGH** (0.75+ threshold): TOOL_SELECTION, PROTOCOL_LOOKUP
   - **MEDIUM** (0.70+ threshold): DOCUMENTATION, MEDICAL_REFERENCE
   - **LOW** (0.60+ threshold): GENERAL_CHAT, other intents
   - Role-aware adjustments: clinicians/admins may use 0.95× multiplier on thresholds

3. ✅ **Abstain Mechanism** (low-confidence handling):
   - Added `shouldAbstain` flag to IntentClassification
   - Added `confidenceThreshold` field to track applied threshold
   - Added `criticality` field (IntentCriticality enum)
   - Updated `method` enum to include `'abstain'` state
   - When confidence < threshold: set `shouldAbstain=true`, `method='abstain'`
   - Defers to human-safe prompts or escalation workflow

4. ✅ **Enhanced NLU Mapping**:
   - Updated `mapNluIntent()` to handle expanded taxonomy
   - Maps NLU model outputs to Phase 1 intents (e.g., "drug_interaction" → MEDICATION_SAFETY)
   - Backward compatible with legacy intent names

5. ✅ **Three-Phase Pipeline with Phase 1 Thresholds**:
   - Phase 1 (Keyword): Compare confidence vs. intent-specific threshold
   - Phase 2 (NLU): Compare NLU confidence vs. NLU intent's threshold
   - Phase 3 (LLM): Compare LLM confidence vs. LLM intent's threshold
   - Each phase respects user role and intent criticality

#### Configuration & Usage:
```typescript
// Helper functions available in intent-classification.dto.ts:
getIntentCriticality(intent: PrimaryIntent): IntentCriticality
getConfidenceThreshold(criticality: IntentCriticality, userRole?: string): number
```

#### Metrics & Monitoring:
- Existing NluMetrics service already tracks method, confidence, phase duration
- Added logging of threshold comparisons for debugging/audit
- Intent criticality now logged in classification decisions

---

## Phase 2 (Near term): Add Task-Specific Neural Heads [✅ IMPLEMENTED]

### Phase 2 Implementation Complete
**Date Completed**: February 5, 2026 (same day as Phase 1)  
**Status**: All three specialized neural heads implemented and integrated

#### Phase 2 Achievements:

**Three Independent Lightweight Neural Heads** (run in parallel, non-blocking):

1. ✅ **Emergency Risk Head** - Fine-grained severity triage
   - Severity levels: CRITICAL, URGENT, MODERATE, LOW
   - Inputs: Message, emergency keywords, user context
   - Outputs: Risk severity, escalation level, risk factors, reasoning
   - Methods: Keyword-based quick detection → LLM fallback
   - Confidence scoring: 0-1 scale per prediction
   - Integration: Non-blocking async enrichment of classification

2. ✅ **Tool Invocation Head** - Multi-class clinical tool routing
   - Supports 9 clinical tools: SOFA, APACHE-II, CURB-65, GCS, Drug Checker, Lab Interpreter, Dose Calculator, CHA2DS2-VASc, Wells DVT
   - Provides primary tool recommendation + alternatives ranked by confidence
   - Extracts required parameters and tracks parameter readiness
   - Methods: Keyword matching for known tools → LLM fallback
   - Parameter extraction integrated for tool-specific queries
   
3. ✅ **Citation Need Head** - RAG grounding requirement determination
   - Citation requirement levels: MANDATORY_CLINICAL, REQUIRED, OPTIONAL, NOT_REQUIRED
   - Mandatory grounding keywords: Drug names, dosing, diagnoses, procedures, protocols, contraindications
   - Tracks clinical verification needs and RAG query topic extraction
   - Methods: Keyword-based detection → LLM assessment with conservative fallback
   - Dual-conservatism: Takes more conservative assessment across methods

#### Phase 2 DTOs & Structures:
- `EmergencyRiskPrediction`: Severity, confidence, risk factors, escalation level
- `ToolInvocationPrediction`: Tool ID, alternatives, required parameters, readiness status
- `CitationNeedPrediction`: Requirement level, grounding topics, verification needs
- `NeuralHeadsResult`: Aggregated predictions, risk scoring, recommended actions
- `DistillationSample`: Dataset structure for teacher-student learning
- `NeuralHeadEvaluationMetrics`: ECE, Brier, confusion matrix, per-class metrics

#### Phase 2 Architecture:
```
IntentClassifier (Phase 1-3: keyword, NLU, LLM)
         ↓
      Result ← Phase 2 enrichment (parallel, non-blocking)
         ↓
    Neural Heads Orchestrator
    ├─ Emergency Risk Head
    ├─ Tool Invocation Head
    └─ Citation Need Head
         ↓
    NeuralHeadsResult (aggregated + actions)
         ↓
   IntentClassification.neuralHeads
```

#### Phase 2 Integration:
- Neural heads results attached asynchronously (fire-and-forget pattern)
- Non-blocking: Always returns Phase 1-3 result immediately
- Fails gracefully: If neural heads fail, returns base classification without heads
- Configuration: Individually toggleable per head via config
- Metrics: Integrated with existing NluMetrics service

#### Aggregated Risk Scoring:
- Combines emergency risk (60% weight), citation needs (30%), tool complexity (10%)
- Generates recommended actions: escalate, ground_response, suggest_tool, flag_for_review
- Actions prioritized by criticality: critical > high > medium > low
- Supports conservative thresholds for medical safety

#### Recommended Next Steps:
- Implement distillation dataset collection pipeline (GPT/Claude → clinician annotation)
- Add calibration evaluation (ECE/Brier) to CI/CD
- Create drift detection dashboard for monitoring
- Deploy shadow mode for local generator (Phase 3 preparation)

## Phase 3 (Medium term): Controlled Local Generator
- Introduce a small/medium healthcare-tuned instruction model for draft generation.
- Keep “safety sandwich”:
  - pre-check classifier,
  - grounded generation (RAG required for clinical claims),
  - post-check verifier (contraindication/risk policy rules),
  - escalation fallback to external model if confidence is low.

## 4) Correspondence Strategy (Your GPT/Claude → Transformer Idea)

To implement “correspondence,” use teacher-student distillation:

1. **Teacher**: GPT/Claude produces structured annotations:
   - intent,
   - risk level,
   - tool ID,
   - rationale tags.
2. **Student**: CareDroid transformer model is trained on these labels + existing labeled data.
3. **Human adjudication loop**: clinicians validate disagreement samples.
4. **Promotion gate**: student replaces teacher for that specific subtask once benchmark thresholds are met.

This achieves neural ownership safely without forcing immediate end-to-end LLM replacement.
